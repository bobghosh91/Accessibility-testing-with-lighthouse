# Accessibility Testing Using Lighthouse

## Introduction
Accessibility testing is crucial to ensure that web applications are usable by people of all abilities, including those with disabilities. One powerful tool for conducting such tests is Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool from Google that assesses web performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. Lighthouse provides developers with detailed audits that identify accessibility issues, such as missing alt text, improper use of ARIA labels, and insufficient color contrast. By using Lighthouse, developers can enhance their applications to be more inclusive, ensuring compliance with web accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and improving the overall user experience.

## What is Accessibility Testing?
Accessibility testing ensures that web or mobile applications are fully usable by all users, including those with disabilities. It focuses on making applications inherently inclusive, allowing individuals with impairments to perform essential tasks independently without the need for external assistance.

## What is Lighthouse?
Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool designed to improve the quality of web pages. It evaluates web pages and provides audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, search engine optimization (SEO), and more.

Lighthouse can be run in several ways, including as a Node module, from the command line, or via Chrome DevTools. By providing a URL, Lighthouse performs audits and generates a report highlighting strengths and areas for improvement. **The report includes details on failing audits, along with reference documents explaining each issue and offering solutions.**

## How to Install Lighthouse Extension:
1. Download Google Chrome for Desktop.
2. Install the [Lighthouse Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

## Steps to Use Lighthouse Extension:
